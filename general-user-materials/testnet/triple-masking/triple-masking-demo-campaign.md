# Triple Masking Demo Campaign

### Download the Triple Masking Demo

To get started, download the Triple Masking Demo from Findora’s website:

1. Visit our website at[ findora.org/testnet](http://findora.org/testnet).
2. Download the Triple Masking Demo.

You might need to bypass the security measures on MacOS and Windows. Allowing the one-time download of the app won’t permanently change your security settings.

When you first try to download it, MacOS will show a warning that this app cannot be downloaded.

To bypass it, go to System Settings >  Privacy and Security and allow the download

### Create a Crypto Wallet

Once you have downloaded the app, create a wallet inside the demo to send and receive triple-masked transactions. Click on the Test Wallet tab. You can import an existing wallet, but the simplest option is to click create to make a new one:

Follow the prompts to create a new crypto wallet.&#x20;

💡 Keep in mind this is a testnet demo, and none of the funds in it will be real. However, it is still best practice to keep your mnemonic phrase secret and to securely store your private key.
{% endhint %}

### Acquiring Testnet Tokens

With your wallet set up, you'll now need some testnet tokens from our testnet [web-faucet](https://faucet.findora.org/). Head to [https://faucet.findora.org/](https://faucet.findora.org/), connect your MetaMask wallet and switch to the QA01 network at the top of the page.

At the bottom of the page, Select “Sealed-FRA” and input your newly created Triple Masking wallet address. It should begin “fra…”

{% hint style="info" %}
💡 Once you hit “Claim,” it may take up to 15 minutes for your tokens to arrive.
{% endhint %}

### Sending a Triple Masked Transaction

Now that you have your tokens, you can participate in the campaign by sending a Triple Masked transaction.

1. Go to the “Send” tab.
2. Select your wallet as the “From” account.
3. Input a “To” account. You can just use the address at the top of the Send tab if you want or create a second wallet to send to.&#x20;

After you've sent the transaction, you'll be directed to a Success page. Click the "View Transaction" button to see your transaction in the block explorer. Clicking “View Transaction” will take you directly to the transaction on the testnet block explorer.&#x20;

As you’ll be able to see, your transaction information is protected; the wallet address, token amount, and token type are all encrypted and not publicly visible.

Your responses will help us improve, and you'll also be entered into a sweepstakes with the chance to win FRA tokens.

Those who finish the Typeform will also be able to join an exclusive Discord chat. There, you’ll be able to talk to others who completed the campaign and share their thoughts about Triple Masking directly with the Discreet Labs team.

### Sweepstakes Rewards

We will be rewarding 10 people in a sweepstakes-style system:

* 1 winner at $100

Winners will be selected based on the quality of their feedback. Rewards will be paid in FRA tokens, the value of which will be based on the tokens' average value over the 7 days after the end of the campaign on May 30th.

We're excited to see your involvement in our campaign. Thank you for your participation!
